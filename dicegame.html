                <h2>Here is a very simple game of sequences or runs.

                Skills learned: Recognizing numbers and sequences, early strategic thinking, and counting by in five
                
                Dice needed: 6
                
                Directions for play:
                
                Each player takes a turn rolling the dice and looking for runs starting with (1-2, 1-2-3, and so on). Each dice part of the run scores five points. A player can only have one run in each roll. The first who reaches 100 points is the winner.
                
                Examples of play:<br><br>
                
                Hand 1:
                
                Player throws six dice and gets the numbers 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, and 1. The following sequences can be scored: 1, 2, 3 (15 points) or 3,2,1 (0 points). The hand is worth 15 points.
                <br><br>
                
                Hand 2:
                
                Player throws six dice and gets the numbers 1, 4, 6, 6, 3, 3. No sequences can be formed, so no score is recorded.</h2>
